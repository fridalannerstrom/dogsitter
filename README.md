## Wireframes
Wireframes were created using [Adobe XD](https://adobexdplatform.com/), with a strong focus on the user goals, business goals, and user stories. These wireframes serve as the foundation for the design and structure of the website.

## Graphic Design & Color Scheme
The design, fonts, and media are all focused on creating a warm, trustworthy feel that reflects nature and the calm of the surrounding forest. The goal is to make the user feel secure and confident in the services, while keeping things professional. At the same time, the design ensures that the message is clear and easy to take in quickly, so users can find what they need without any hassle.

### Colors

- **Primary Color:** The design primarily uses three shades of green as the main color. Green was chosen for its strong association with nature, conveying a sense of calm and reliability ‚Äîq ualities that align well with the values of a dog-sitting service in a rural setting. Additionally, green represents safety and harmony, which are qualities that Sunne Dogcare wants to convey to its users.
- **Secondary Color:** A warm, light color is used as the secondary color to add warmth to the design. This shade leans towards orange, a color often linked with happiness and positivity, which complements the joyful and caring atmosphere of the business.
- **Base Colors:** Black and white are employed as the base colors. Black adds contrast and elegance, helping to ground the design and highlight key elements, while white brings clarity and simplicity, ensuring that the overall message is clear and easy to read. 

Together, these colors create a balanced and professional look, enhancing the user experience without overwhelming the content.

 ![Colors](assets/images/documentation/colors.png)

### Fonts

#### Fonts choosen
- **Lora** for headings ‚Äì a serif font that conveys a professional and trustworthy impression, adding a sense of seriousness and reliability to the site. 
- **Work Sans** for paragraph text ‚Äì a basic and modern sans-serif font chosen for its readability, particularly on screens and smaller devices.

By combining a serif and a sans-serif font, the design achieves a balanced look that feels both professional and approachable, as well as inviting and personal. These two fonts complement each other well, enhancing the overall user experience.

#### Fonts styling

- **Lora** for headings (H1, H2)
- **Work Sans** for paragraphs and H3 (Work Sans used instead of Lora for H3 due to better readability).
- **Highlighted text** is Work Sans in bold green
- **Topic Tag**, to help users quickly identify content, has a green background and light, uppercase text in Work Sans.
- **Links** are underlined in green with arrow icon.
- **CTA Buttons** come in two styles: Light, with white background and black text, and Dark, with green background and white text. Both light and dark have the same hover style.

 ![Headings, text and buttons](assets/images/documentation/heading-text-buttons.png)

### Logotype
The logo for Sunne Dogcare uses the font [Hot Mess by Sam Parrett](https://www.behance.net/gallery/79231099/Hot-Mess-SVG-Font). This slightly messy, handwritten font was chosen to create a contrast with the otherwise clean and polished design of the brand. The playful, informal style of the font reflects the more unpredictable and sometimes chaotic nature of dog-sitting, making it a fitting choice for the brand.

 ![Logotype](assets/images/documentation/logotype.png)

### Icons

The icons used throughout the design are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) in the bold solid style. Icons are an important part of the branding, as they help convey messages in a simpler and more visual way. The icons chosen are closely associated with dogs and nature, such as a bone, paw print, and forest.

 ![Icons](assets/images/documentation/icons.png)

### Media

The images used on the site will focus on dogs highlighting themes of nature, forest, warmth, and joy. The photos will predominantly feature green and natural bright tones to align with the overall design, avoiding sharp or overly bright colors. Warm, earthy hues will be prioritized to create a welcoming and soothing atmosphere, reinforcing the connection to the countryside and the caring environment that Sunne Dogcare offers. All images will have rounded borders to create a softer and more welcoming feel.

Additionally, some background images are used with a subtle green overlay.

## UI/UX Design

The final mockups for the UI were created using [Adobe XD](https://adobexdplatform.com/). The design focuses on a clean and light aesthetic with a clear information hierarchy. Call-to-Actions (CTAs) are designed to be noticeable, encouraging interaction. The overall design aims to provide an intuitive and positive experience for the users.

## Feature Changes

Throughout the development process, changes were made to the design, content, sections, and features to enhance usability and clarity. These adjustments were necessary to ensure a better user experience. The changes are listed below.

| Action | Section | Reason | Before | After |
| ------ | ------- | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| **üóëÔ∏èRemoval** | Contact form | Having two contact forms was unnecessary and caused confusion. The contact form was removed and replaced with a CTA box. Now, only one form remains: the booking form. | ![Old Contact Form](assets/images/documentation/contact-form.png) | ![CTA-box](assets/images/documentation/cta-section.png) | 
| **‚Äçüé®Design Change** | Service Page | The service section felt cluttered with too many boxes. The large yellow box was removed, and instead, individual boxes were used for the list, resulting in a cleaner and lighter design. On desktop, a thin grey border was added to better separate the different sections. | ![Old Services](assets/images/documentation/services-old.png) | ![New Services](assets/images/documentation/services-page-desktop.png) | 
| **üóëÔ∏èRemoval** | Service Button | Having a separate CTA button for booking each service was unnecessary, as the same booking form applies to all services. | ![Old Services Button](assets/images/documentation/services-old.png) | ![New Services Button](assets/images/documentation/services-page-desktop.png) |
