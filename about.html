                    <p>With over 10 years of experience, caring for dogs has become both a profession and a passion. I
                        love spending time in nature with dogs by my side. Working from home full-time allows me to be
                        flexible and always available to welcome dogs into my home.</p>

                    <h3>Rufus</h3>
                    <p class="bold-text">1 year old Australian Labradoodle</p>
                    <p>Rufus is an incredibly happy and friendly dog who loves making new friends – both human and
                        canine! He’s met dogs of all kinds and is wonderful at helping others with socialization. Rufus
                        is always eager to please and is especially fond of playing fetch – he could chase a ball for
                        hours until he’s completely worn out!</p>

                    <p>Rufus also enjoys long runs alongside the bike and is always up for a walk in the woods. As a
                        true farm dog, he rarely needs a leash and prefers the freedom of running loose, though we
                        regularly practice walking on a leash, even if it’s not his favorite. With his gentle nature,
                        Rufus gets along with everyone – dogs, people, and children alike. He’s simply the sweetest,
                        most lovable companion you could ask for.</p>

                    <h3>Wilda</h3>
                    <p class="bold-text">10 year old Maltipoo</p>
                    <p>Wilda is an older lady, nearing 11 years, who now enjoys the simple pleasures in life. Her
                        favorite activities include napping in the sun or snuggling up in someone's arms. While long
                        walks in the woods are no longer her thing, she still has a spark of energy when it comes to
                        playtime. She’s always kind to other dogs but knows when enough is enough – if things get too
                        rowdy, she’ll let them know it’s time to calm down.</p>

                    <p>Wilda is incredibly social and absolutely adores people. The moment you meet her, she’ll treat
                        you like her new best friend, eager for pets and affection. Even though she’s slowed down a bit,
                        she remains the sweetest companion, always happy to be by your side.</p>

                    <p>We are located on a beautiful countryside farm, surrounded by lush forests and open fields, far
                        away from any busy roads. Our property spans over 6000 square meters, offering your dog plenty
                        of space to explore and play. Of this, 150 square meters are dedicated to a fenced-in dog yard.
                        Inside our spacious 200 square meter home, dogs are always welcome, ensuring they feel
                        comfortable and at ease. </p>

                    <p>Our farm is home to our family: myself, my husband, and our 8-year-old daughter, along with our
                        two dogs, Wilda and Rufus. We also have three cats who are well accustomed to being around dogs,
                        and a hamster (though the dogs never meet the hamster!). Soon, our farm will be growing, with
                        chickens and goats joining the mix. It's a peaceful, animal-friendly environment where every
                        creature is loved and well cared for.</p>
